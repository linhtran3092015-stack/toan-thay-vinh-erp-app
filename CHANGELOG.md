# Changelog

All notable changes to Toan Thay Vinh ERP will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.1.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- **Universal Staff Self-Attendance**: Granted `timekeeping.check` permission across all active staff roles (Owner, Admin, Accountant, Management Assistant, Teaching Assistant, Sales) via database migration `20260813020000_grant_timekeeping_check_to_all_staff_roles.sql`.
- **Topbar Attendance Action**: Added a prominent "Chấm công" button to the right side of the topbar, positioned immediately to the left of the light/dark theme toggle, with white text and clock icon styling across light and dark themes.

### Fixed
- **Timekeeping Route Permission Model**: Fixed authorization on `/timekeeping` to allow staff accounts with `timekeeping.check` to access and operate their own attendance panel while strictly isolating administrative staff attendance lists and shift schedule tables to users with `timekeeping.view`.
